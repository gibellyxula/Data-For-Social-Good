1. Who Helped Us:
- AI

What we asked:
- “Can you please separate this list by putting quotation marks around each value 
and then separating them all with a comma in one single line."

What response we recieved:
- A list of the breed values in the txt file that were separated by commas and quotation marks.
We were going to use that list intially, but we changed our mind and rewrote our code.

2. Who Helped Us:
- AI

What we asked:
- “Can you please fix this list to have no quotation marks?”

What response we recieved:
- ChatGPT gave us the breeds name list without the quotation marks that were from the original list,
so we could use that for the System.out.println() line of code we have in the scanner method.

3. Who Helped Us:
- Mr.Aiello

What we asked:
- How can we fix the errors that are popping up when we run the program,
and why does the program only allow us to type the name of the breed of the dog 
and it doesn't print out any information in the console?

What response we recieved:
- Mr. Aiello explained to us the missing method that we needed in order for our program to work as intended.
He also went through our code and deleted unneccessary lines of code that were causing the program to produce
the error message.

4. Who Helped Us:
- Google

What we asked:
- To explain certain code vocabulary that we didn't remember in order to write our comments/code

What response we recieved:
-Explanations of the vocab words such as the accessor method.

5. What Helped Us:
- Previous levels on Code.org

How did this help?:
- We were able to reference back to the levels to help us write our methods when we got stuck on what to write.

6. We also used AI or asked other classmates to help guide us to what was wrong with some code segements 
when we worked on the project outside of class.
