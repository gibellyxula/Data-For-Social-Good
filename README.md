# Data-For-Social-Good
This program gives people some information about dogs based on the breed they chose.
# Unit 2 - Data for Social Good Project

## Introduction

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## User Story 
As a young woman searching for her first ever dog, <br>
I want to find the perfect dog for me, <br>
so that I can fullfill my childhood dreams of having the perfect companion.

## Dataset 

Include a hyperlink to the source of your dataset used for this project. Additionally, provide a short description of each column used from the dataset, and the data type. 
Dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H5PXIV7F8tVom4Zcc1-wX65Ku-RtyRKkzeWeGxpka_4/edit?usp=sharing
- **Name** (String) - the name of the breed of dog
- **Breed Group** (String) - type of breed the dog is 
- **Minimum Life Span** (int) - the minimum amount of years the dog will live
- **Maximum Height** (int) - the highest height the dog will reach
- **Maximum Weight** (int) - the maximum weight that the dog will reach

## Description 
Write a description of your project here. In your description, include as many vocab words from our class to explain your User Story, the chosen dataset and how your project addressed that users goals. If your project used the Scanner class for user input, explain how the user will interact with your project.
